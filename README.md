# SpaceLads

_retro-like web game_

Spacelads is a retro styled space shooter. When I started work on this project I had little to no experiences in programming. (Before this project I was just doing static websites with no interactivity). When I was finished, I used this project as graduation work in high school.

## branch list

1. **main/master:** I used this version for my graduation at high school
2. **alpha:** My initial version
3. **beta:** Almost finished
4. **main-dev:** My ideal version
