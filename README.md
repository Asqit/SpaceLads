# SpaceLads
*retro-like web game*

This is my first BIG javascript project. Before this project I had almost no experience with javascript. I wanted to make my own browser game. Since I don't like 
platformer type games I wanted to make space shoot like space invaders. So the spacelads was born. Originally I wanted to call it SpaceMan, but my friend told me its stupid.
