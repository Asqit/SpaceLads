# SpaceLads

_retro-like web game_

Spacelads is a retro-styled space shooter made in vanilla `JavaScript`. 

When I started work on this project I had little to no experiences in programming. (Before this project I was just doing static websites with no interactivity). When I was finished, I used this project as graduation work in high school (2021).
