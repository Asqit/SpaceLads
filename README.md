# SpaceLads

Spacelads is my first bigger `JavaScript` project. I've used it as graduation work in my high school days. Premise is simple, you are a tiny spaceship and you
have to kill as many aliens as possible. My graduation version was release, so If you are looking for that, check releases page.
This is improved new version made entirely in `TypeScript`.

3. install dependencies: `npm install`
